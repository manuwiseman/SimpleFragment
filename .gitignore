It's good, thanks. But how to ignore some directories, such as target, out, production?

Great resource - many thanks for sharing.
@dreftymac

Some examples with directories per https://gist.github.com/ThomsonTang suggestion would help round out this already excellent tip

I think .dll files are important if you're developing with .NET.

Also, you could include .ai, .eps, and .psd on it.

Thanks, for the great snippet.

Hi, I added some IDE files (of NetBeans, Eclipse and Zend Studio) to ignore. Look at:

@danielcosta

@arulrajnet @cptstarling it is not recommended to ignore entire .idea directory. Instead we should add only the two lines below to local .gitignore file:

/.idea/workspace.xml
/.idea/tasks.xml
This way all good project configuration (for example Code Style, namespaces mapping, etc) will be shared among all team.

What if I want to ignore all .txt files, but one? For example all the txt files out, but keep important.txt ?
@hppavilion1
hppavilion1 commented on May 1, 2015
*.log isn't working for me. I have the logs 'server.log', 'connected.log', and 'visitorcount.log' in a folder named 'logs', and GitHub Desktop keeps asking me to commit the files whenever they are modified.

I'm using Notepad to add these updates and have rebooted GitHub Desktop. Is there any weird technical feature that I am missing?

Here's a more robust version of the vim ignores for your global .gitignore:

**/*~
**/*.bak
**/*.sw[abcdefghijklmnop]

Thank you . Quite a useful example.

@hppavilion1 you should add **/ prefix. It'll include all subfolders as well.

ex:

**/*.log*
@ScottyMJacobson
ScottyMJacobson commented on Sep 29, 2015
Should *.sql really be ignored? I've seen instances where raw migrations are saved in .sql format and would be important to commit.

does adding .gitignore inside the .gitignore file affect anything generally?
@marnen
marnen commented on Oct 27, 2015
\#*\# would also be worth adding.
@giovannipds
giovannipds commented on Nov 18, 2015
And *.sublime-workspace for those who use SublimeText. It's important not adding these files, for security reasons.
@giovannipds
giovannipds commented on Nov 18, 2015
And I agree with @ScottyMJacobson, *.sql files are important for some projects, I'm used to adding the initial version of the database this way. Suits me well... any advices?
@richard-kinder
richard-kinder commented on Feb 17
.gitignore to default list.
@Kilobyte22
Kilobyte22 commented on Mar 21
vim swapfiles (*.swp) should be added as those do not belong into a repository
